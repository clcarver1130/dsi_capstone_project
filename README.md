# Defending Credit for the World's Poor

As a Westerner, getting a credit card is only slightly more complicated than tying my shoes. My world is raining with opportunities to borrow money to go to school, open a store, consolidate loans, or buy an iPhone 6. For poor global citizens, though, the game is different. In fact, there isn’t a game. A small business loan in developing countries usually requires a bank account (which 80% of sub-saharan Africans do not have), carries exorbitant interest rates (50%+), and are otherwise unreachable or unaffordable to the majority. The reality is that it’s simply not profitable for lending agencies to accommodate these high-risk, small-scale borrowers.

The irony is that these are precisely the people whose lives can be most dramatically improved by a small amount of liquidity. Their hardship is enormous, and emerging from it is often complex or impossible due to systematic constraints (poverty traps). Enter the world of microfinance, where nonprofit agencies like Kiva and Grameen seek out and create loans for those in the greatest need. With a small amount of cash, these industrious borrowers seek to start small businesses and pull themselves out of poverty. Microfinance loans may not be the best ROI, but in terms of human impact, the dollars are well invested (catalytic philanthropy).
